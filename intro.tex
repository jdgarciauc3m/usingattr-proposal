\section{Introduction}

This paper proposes a new attribute to take control on attributes namespace
in order to avoid the need of repetitive use of attributes namespaces.

Attributes~\cite{n2761} provide a useful way to add annotations to source code with
implementation defined effects. Implementations are expected to add their
own attribute namespace where their attributes are defined. In fact,
scoped attributes--those under a specific namespace--are specified
as conditionally supported. While this approach
provides a clean way for different implementations to add their own attributes,
it may lead to very verbose code.

To better support the introduction of conditionally supported attributes we
propose the introduction of a new standard attribute, the \cppkey{using} attribute,
to avoid repetition of attribute namespaces when making extensive use
of attributes to perform code annotations.
