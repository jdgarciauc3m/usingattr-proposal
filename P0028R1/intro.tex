\section{Introduction}

This paper proposes a new attribute introducer to 
avoid the need of repetitive use of attributes namespaces.

Attributes~\cite{n2761} provide a useful way to add annotations to source code
with implementation defined effects. Implementations are expected to add their
own attribute namespace where their attributes are defined. In fact, scoped
attributes ---those under a specific namespace--- are specified as
conditionally supported. While this approach provides a clean way for different
implementations to add their own attributes, it may lead to very verbose code.

To better support the introduction of conditionally supported attributes we
propose the addition of an attribute introducer, to avoid repetition of
attribute namespaces when making extensive use of attributes to perform code
annotations.
