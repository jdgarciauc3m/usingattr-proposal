This paper proposes possible solutions for the previously identified problems

\subsection{Handling unknown attribute namespaces}

Having scoped attributes as conditionally supported provides the degree of
freedom that allows an implementation not to support a specific attribute namespace.
However, this is not enough to clarify what are the valid options for an
implementation when it finds an attribute namespace it does not know about.

This paper proposes to add the following non-normative note to section 7.6.1 [dcl.attr.grammar]:

\vspace{1em}
\emph{[Note: All occurrences of an attribute namespace that is not conditionally supported
by the implementation will be ignored. --- end note]}
