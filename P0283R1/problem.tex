\section{Problem}

Attributes have proved to be a very useful way to perform
source code annotations. However, to improve their use 
attributes namespaces need to be better clarified.

\subsection{Handling unknown attribute namespaces}

During the committee meeting at Kona it was pointed out that \emph{``We don't
have a requirement that implementations ignore attribute namespaces that they
do not understand. So my users hide attributes behind macros''}. This is something
that needs to be clarified in order to avoid attributes being hidden by macros.

Currently, the standard states in 7.6.1/3 that \emph{``The use of an
attribute-scoped-token is conditionally-supported, with implementation-defined
behavior''}. Making namespaced attributes conditionally supported means that
they will not be understood by implementations that do not cover that namespace.
