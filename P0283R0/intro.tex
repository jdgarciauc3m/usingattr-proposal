\section{Introduction}

This paper tries to clarify the use of attributes namespaces. In particular,
it tries to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item What happens if an implementation finds a reference to an attribute namespace
      that it does not know about?

\item What happens if an implementation finds a reference to an unqualified
attribute which is not defined in the standard?

\end{itemize}

Attributes~\cite{n2761} provide a useful way to add annotations to source code
with implementation defined effects. Implementations are expected to add their
own attribute namespace where their attributes are defined. In fact, scoped
attributes ---those under a specific namespace--- are specified as
conditionally supported. This approach provides a clean way for different
implementations to add their own attributes.
